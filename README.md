# Hi, I'm Wilson Whisnant

I'm a career-switching software developer and data analyst building a portfolio at the intersection of health, tech, and efficiency. With over a decade of real-world operations experience and deep domain expertise in hospitality and wellness, I'm now focused on creating scalable software and data systems that solve meaningful problems.

## Tech Stack & Tools

- **Languages:** Python, SQL, JavaScript (learning), HTML/CSS  
- **Frameworks:** Flask  
- **Databases & Data Tools:** PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, DBeaver  
- **Dev Tools:** Git, Linux/WSL, VS Code  
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Excel, Tableau

# Featured Project

## AI-Powered Code Assistant & Legacy Refactor Tool  
A secure, terminal-based AI assistant that integrates with the **Gemini API** to analyze and refactor legacy Python code.

** Project Highlights**
- Built a CLI tool that uses an LLM (Gemini Flash 2.0) to perform secure code analysis, logic improvement, and prompt-driven refactoring  
- Designed guardrails including **path whitelisting**, **extension filtering**, and a **30-second execution timeout** to prevent unsafe code execution  
- Applied the assistant to a poorly written legacy calculator module to demonstrate real-world AI-assisted refactoring workflows  
- Modular architecture with reusable Python utilities for file access, safe execution, and function routing

** Skills Demonstrated**
- Secure LLM integration (`dotenv`, command safety, structured prompts)  
- Prompt engineering for debugging, refactoring, and code quality enhancement  
- Python code restructuring, logic bug identification, and modularization  
- CLI-based interaction, unit testing, and Python project organization

> “This project showcases how AI can act as a copilot — not just to generate code, but to refactor legacy logic within defined security boundaries.”

## In Progress
- **Liquor Inventory App (C#/ASP.NET):** Multi-location, weight-based inventory tracker built for the bar/hospitality industry — complete with barcode scanning and authentication  
- **Home Server Lab:** Hands-on practice with Docker, deployment, backups, and network-level services like Git hosting, CI/CD, reverse proxy, and metrics  
- **RESTful Backends:** Implementing soft deletion, filtering/searching, and clean routing in Flask apps  
- **JavaScript & TypeScript:** Building frontend fundamentals for future full-stack work

## Goals
- Land a **software developer** or **backend/data engineering** role with real-world ownership  
- Publish and maintain **production-ready apps** across health, hospitality, and automation  
- Build a portfolio that shows not just technical skill — but **system design**, operational awareness, and practical execution
