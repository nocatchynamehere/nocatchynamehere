Howdy, I'm nocatchynamehere.

I come from a pretty heavy background of bartending.  Looking to get into something new in my spare time.

I'm learning everything I can on the basics of python.  Working my way through the "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" and "Python Crash Course" books.  Any words of advice are highly appreciated.
