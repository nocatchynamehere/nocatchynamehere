# 👋 Hi, I'm Wilson Whisnant

I'm a career-switching software developer and data analyst building a portfolio at the intersection of health, tech, and efficiency. With over a decade of real-world operations experience and deep domain expertise in hospitality and wellness, I'm now focused on creating scalable software and data systems that solve meaningful problems.

## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools

- **Languages (currently learning):** Python, SQL, JavaScript, HTML/CSS
- **Frameworks:** Flask
- **Data & DB:** PostgreSQL, Pandas, SQLAlchemy, DBeaver
- **Tools:** Git, Linux/WSL, VS Code
- **Analytics & Reporting:** Excel, Tableau

## 🚀 Featured Project

### 🏋️‍♂️ Fitness Tracker (Flask + PostgreSQL)
A full-stack personal health tracker web app:
- Modular Flask routes with Jinja templating and HTML form validation
- PostgreSQL schema modeled for extensibility (workouts, sleep, nutrition)
- Flash messaging, structured input forms, and pending analytics dashboard
- Built with the structure and polish of a user-facing platform, not just a development prototype.

## 🚧 In Progress
- Building a home server lab to practice real-world DevOps, deployment, and backend hosting
- Learning JavaScript and TypeScript to transition toward full-stack development
- Implementing soft deletion logic, searchable records, and REST API endpoints in current apps

## 🎯 Goals
- Land a software developer or backend/data engineering role
- Publish, host, and maintain production-grade applications
- Build a portfolio that shows not just skills, but systems thinking and execution
